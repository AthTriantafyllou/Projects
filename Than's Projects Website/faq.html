      Here you can find a general overview of how each project in <strong>Than’s Projects</strong> is built including the main technologies, structure, and logic used.  
      This is not the raw source code (you can find the raw code on my <a href="https://github.com/AthTriantafyllou" target="_blank">Github Account</a>).

      <h3>🌐 Website</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The main website is built using <strong>HTML</strong> for structure and <strong>CSS</strong> for styling.
        It follows a modular design with folders for pages, games, and shared assets.
        The layout is responsive, meaning it adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.
        The site uses simple navigation links and grid layouts to display projects neatly.
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Main technologies:</strong> HTML, CSS</li>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Modular folder system for easy scalability</li>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> A clean, organized platform to host multiple interactive projects</li>

      <p>
        The Wavelength game is an interactive 2-player browser game built primarily in
        <strong>JavaScript</strong>. It uses <strong>HTML</strong> for layout and <strong>CSS</strong> for design.
        The logic includes category selection, hidden scoring zones, and dynamic point calculation.
        Smooth animations when points are scored.

      <h3>🎮 Ultimate TicTacToe</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The Ultimate TicTacToe game is very similar to the wavelength one. It's built primarily in
        <strong>JavaScript</strong>. It uses <strong>HTML</strong> for layout and <strong>CSS</strong> for design.
        The logic is in JS and includes active player switches, checking for a winner each turn, helping the players as to which block they should play,
        and keeping the score.
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Main technologies:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
        <li><strong>Features:</strong> Checking for a winner, active player switch</li>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> A better version of the normal TicTacToe. It's harder to memorize unlike the normal version because the potential moves are countless</li>
      </ul>
