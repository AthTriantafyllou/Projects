    <h2>About Than's Games</h2>
    <p>
      👋 Hey! I'm <b>Athanasios Triantafyllou.</b> One day I got <u>bored</u>, I wanted a way to learn about programming languages like Javascript, Html, Css, React.js. I tried learning through w3schools,
      Leetcode, and everything in between. But it didn't do as well as I hoped. Learning and not implimenting right away is the recipe to forget. That's why I desided that if I am going
      to learn something it HAS to be through <b>doing it.</b> 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      That's how Than's Projects started. I am trying every day to think about new stuff to add, new ideas to create, whilst of course learning how to code from this. <b>That's why its fun.</b>
      Than's Projects is not something super professional, it's my coding playground. Some stuff may work great, others may be under construction. But if I want to test something out,
      that's where I come.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feel free to look around, maybe play some games, experiment with any project. You may like some of them. If you do, I will be thrilled to find out that you liked them, and obviously
      if you have any issues please let me know. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I am guessing that if you found out this page exist, you must have a way of contacting me.🤪
