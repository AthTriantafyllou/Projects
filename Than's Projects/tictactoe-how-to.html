      <h3>🧾 Overview</h3>
        <br>

      Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is an advanced version of classic Tic-Tac-Toe. 
      Instead of one 3×3 board, you play on <strong>nine smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards</strong> arranged in a 3×3 grid. 
      Each small board represents one cell of the larger “mega” board.</p>
<br>

      <h3>🎯 Objective</h3>
      
      <p>Win the game by claiming <strong>three large boards in a row</strong> — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
<br>

      <h3>⚙️ Setup</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Player 1 uses <strong>X</strong>.</li>
        <li>Player 2 uses <strong>O</strong>.</li>
        <li>The game begins with all nine small boards empty.</li>
      </ul>
<br>

      <h3>🕹️ Gameplay</h3>
    
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Starting move:</strong> Player 1 can place an X anywhere on the entire grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Directing the next move:</strong> The cell chosen determines <em>which board</em> the next player must play in.
          <br>Example: If you place your mark in the <em>top-right cell</em> of a small board, your opponent must play in the <em>top-right large board</em>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Winning a small board:</strong> Win a small board by completing three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). 
          The board then shows a large faded X or O and becomes locked.
        </li>
        <li><strong>If the directed board is already complete:</strong> If the target board is already won or tied, 
          the next player may play <em>anywhere</em> on the grid that’s still open.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning the game:</strong> Win the entire match by winning three large boards in a row on the mega grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Ties:</strong> If all large boards are full with no winner, the match ends in a tie.</li>
      </ol>
<br>

      <h3>💡 Additional Notes</h3>
    
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>active board</strong> (where the next move must be played) is highlighted with a red outline.</li>
        <li>Boards that have been won appear <strong>faded</strong> with a large X or O overlay.</li>
        <li>You can <strong>reset</strong> the game at any time to start a new round.</li>
        <li>The <strong>scoreboard</strong> keeps track of total wins and ties across rounds.</li>
      </ul>
